<h2 id="technologies">Technologies</h2><hr>

<ul>
    <li>Python was the main language for this project.</li>
    <li>Text to ASCII Art Generator.</li>
    <li>Gitpod workspace to create the project.</li>
    <li>GitHub to store the project online.</li>
    <li>Heroku to host python project live.</li>
    <li>Code Institute Template to start the project</li>
    <li>CI Python Linter to test the code</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2><hr>

<h3>Manual Testing</h3><hr>
<p>I carefully tested the game to make sure everything is functional. including the main page, the categories, the levels of difficulty, the game itself, and the ending after a win or loss.</p>

<h3>Validator</h3><hr>
<p>I ran the code via CI Python Linter to ensure there were no issues. With the exception of the text areas where I utilized ASCII graphics, the code was error-free.
I didn't change anything because the game was still able to run without any problems.iculty, the game itself, and the ending after a win or loss.</p>

<h2 id="bugs">Bugs</h2><hr>
<ul>
    <li>When you add more than one letter at a time, the computer recognizes it as a valid guess and updates the hangman game state.</li>
    <li>The hangman game state is updated when a number or any other signÂ is added and the software accepts it as a valid guess.</li>
    <li>When the game generated a random word that was more than one word, empty spaces were replaced with underscores, thus I opted to delete these words from the list because I couldn't fix the problem.</li>
</ul>

<p>This project was the first project so far that I really struggled with. From the confusing course material to poor selection of walk trough project. I tried to gain more knowledge from other sources but was to late due to the deadline and a limited amount of time that I had to finish the project.</p>
